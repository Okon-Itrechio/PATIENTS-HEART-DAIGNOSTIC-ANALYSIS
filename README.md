# PATIENTS-HEART-DIAGNOSTIC-ANALYSIS
## Project Overview

This project aims at analyzing key insight from patient’s checkup at hospital to determine whether they have heart disease using factors such as blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate, chest pains and cholesterol.

## Data Source
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

## Methods
•	Data Cleaning and Preparation: The dataset was cleaned and numbers were also replaced with values in fasting blood sugar column (0-False, 1-True) and target column (0-No disease, 1-Disease).

•	Data Visualization: Power BI was used to create dashboards and visual reports to highlight key metrics such as fasting blood sugar by age, chest pain by age, resting blood pressure by sex, heart rate by age and disease by age.

## Tools
1.	Microsoft Excel for data cleaning
2.	SQL Server for coding
3.	Power BI for creation of dashboard and visualization
   
## Insights and Findings

•	Male patients had higher blood pressure than the female patients. Male- 69.08% while female – 30.92%

•	Male patients were prone to chest pains than the female patients. Female: Male -39K:18K

•	There is increased in heart rate in male patients than female patients. 

•	Finally, female patients had more heart disease than the male patients. Percentage of female patients with disease is 70.85% and without disease is 29.15% while that of male patients with disease 39.67% and without disease is 60.33%

## Conclusion
The analysis revealed that females generally irrespective of age difference are prone to having heart disease.

## Recommendations
•	Regular checkups at intervals should be carried to diagnose heart disease in time and commence treatment

•	Female patients should be given priority in hospitals as they are the most venerable.
